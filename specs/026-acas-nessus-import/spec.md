# Feature Specification: ACAS/Nessus Scan Import

**Feature Branch**: `026-acas-nessus-import`  
**Created**: 2025-03-12  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "Import vulnerability scan results from ACAS .nessus files. Teams export from ACAS and import to ATO Copilot can automatically map to controls."

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-03-12

- Q: What uniquely identifies an ACAS finding for conflict resolution purposes? → A: Plugin ID + Hostname + Port (one finding per plugin per host per port)
- Q: Who should be authorized to import .nessus files? → A: ISSO + SCA + System Admin only
- Q: Which ACAS finding severities should generate POA&M weakness entries? → A: Critical + High + Medium (CAT I + CAT II)
- Q: Should the plugin-family-to-control-family heuristic mapping table be curated (fixed) or user-extensible? → A: Curated (fixed) — ship a built-in mapping table, extend in future releases
- Q: Should informational (severity 0) plugins be persisted as findings in the database? → A: Exclude from findings, include in summary counts only (lean, compliance-focused)

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 — Import ACAS .nessus File (Priority: P1)

An ISSO, SCA, or System Admin exports a .nessus vulnerability scan file from ACAS (Assured Compliance Assessment Solution) and imports it into ATO Copilot for a registered system. The system parses the XML, extracts all vulnerability findings (plugins), and persists them as compliance findings linked to the target system.

**Why this priority**: This is the foundational capability — without file parsing and finding creation, no downstream features (control mapping, reporting) can function. It delivers immediate value by centralizing vulnerability data that currently lives in disconnected ACAS exports.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by uploading a sample .nessus file for a registered system and verifying that findings appear with correct plugin IDs, severities, CVEs, and host information.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a registered system exists and the user has an exported .nessus file from ACAS, **When** the user imports the file via the MCP tool, **Then** the system parses all `<ReportHost>` entries and creates a `ScanImportRecord` with status `Completed` and individual findings for each plugin result.
2. **Given** a .nessus file containing multiple hosts, **When** the file is imported, **Then** findings are created for each host-plugin combination with the correct hostname, IP address, and port information preserved.
3. **Given** a .nessus file with plugins of varying severity (Critical, High, Medium, Low, Informational), **When** imported, **Then** each non-informational finding reflects the correct severity mapped to the existing CAT severity scale (Critical/High → CAT I, Medium → CAT II, Low → CAT III). Informational plugins (severity 0) are counted in the import summary but not persisted as individual findings.
4. **Given** an invalid or malformed .nessus file, **When** the user attempts import, **Then** the system returns a clear error message indicating the parse failure and no partial data is persisted.
5. **Given** the same .nessus file is imported a second time for the same system, **When** using "Skip" conflict resolution, **Then** duplicate findings are skipped and the import record reflects the skip count.

---

### User Story 2 — Automatic Control Mapping (Priority: P1)

After importing a .nessus file, ATO Copilot automatically maps each vulnerability finding to the applicable NIST 800-53 controls. This mapping uses the plugin's CVE references to resolve through CCI (Control Correlation Identifier) crosswalks and the existing STIG-to-CCI-to-NIST chain, as well as direct plugin-family-to-control-family heuristics for findings without CVE cross-references.

**Why this priority**: Automatic control mapping is the core differentiator — without it, teams must manually correlate thousands of vulnerability findings to controls, which is the primary pain point this feature solves.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by importing a .nessus file containing plugins with known CVEs and verifying that the resulting findings are linked to the correct NIST 800-53 controls.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a .nessus plugin result includes CVE references that map to known CCI entries, **When** the import completes, **Then** the finding's resolved NIST control IDs contain the correct NIST 800-53 control IDs derived from the CVE → CCI → NIST chain.
2. **Given** a vulnerability plugin has no CVE references but belongs to a known plugin family (e.g., "Windows: Microsoft Bulletins"), **When** imported, **Then** the system applies plugin-family-to-control-family heuristic mapping and flags the mapping confidence as "Heuristic" rather than "Definitive".
3. **Given** a plugin has CVE references that do not resolve to any known CCI entry, **When** imported, **Then** the finding is created with an empty control mapping and a warning is logged indicating the unresolved CVEs.
4. **Given** the system has a control baseline assigned, **When** findings are mapped to controls, **Then** only controls within the baseline generate `ControlEffectiveness` records; out-of-baseline control mappings are preserved on the finding but do not create effectiveness records.

---

### User Story 3 — Import Summary and Dry-Run Preview (Priority: P2)

Before committing an import, the user can perform a dry-run to preview what the import will produce — how many findings will be created, updated, or skipped, and which controls will be affected. After a committed import, the user receives a comprehensive summary.

**Why this priority**: Dry-run capability builds user confidence and prevents unintended data changes, especially for large .nessus files with thousands of plugins. Essential for operational trust but not required for core data flow.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by running a dry-run import and verifying the preview report matches a subsequent committed import.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a user uploads a .nessus file with dry-run mode enabled, **When** the import completes, **Then** the system returns a full preview (findings count by severity, control mappings, host inventory) without persisting any data.
2. **Given** a committed import completes, **When** the user views the import record, **Then** the summary includes: total plugins processed, findings created, findings updated, findings skipped, unresolved mappings, hosts scanned, and NIST controls affected.
3. **Given** a .nessus file with 5,000+ plugins, **When** a dry-run is performed, **Then** the preview completes and returns results without timeout or excessive resource consumption.

---

### User Story 4 — Import History and Re-Import Management (Priority: P2)

Users can view the history of all ACAS/Nessus imports for a system, compare results across scan dates, and re-import updated scans with configurable conflict resolution (skip, overwrite, or merge).

**Why this priority**: Import management enables ongoing vulnerability tracking across assessment cycles. Important for continuous monitoring but not required for initial import functionality.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by importing two .nessus files for the same system on different dates and verifying the import history shows both, with correct finding counts and the ability to re-import with overwrite.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** multiple .nessus files have been imported for a system over time, **When** the user queries import history, **Then** each import record is listed with date, file name, host count, finding counts, and status.
2. **Given** a new ACAS scan is performed and the user imports the updated .nessus file with "Overwrite" conflict resolution, **When** the import processes a plugin-host combination that already exists, **Then** the existing finding is updated with the new scan data and the import record reflects the update count.
3. **Given** a user imports with "Merge" conflict resolution, **When** a finding already exists for the same plugin-host, **Then** the system keeps the more-recent status and appends any new details or comments without losing historical data.

---

### User Story 5 — POA&M and Weakness Source Integration (Priority: P3)

Open vulnerability findings from ACAS imports automatically populate as weaknesses in the Plan of Action & Milestones (POA&M) workflow with `WeaknessSource` set to "ACAS". This enables teams to track remediation of ACAS-identified vulnerabilities through the existing POA&M lifecycle.

**Why this priority**: POA&M integration provides downstream value from imported scan data but depends on existing POA&M functionality and the core import pipeline being in place first.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by importing a .nessus file with open Critical/High/Medium findings and verifying that corresponding POA&M weakness entries are created with source "ACAS".

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** ACAS findings with severity Critical, High, or Medium are imported, **When** the import completes, **Then** corresponding weakness entries are created (or updated) in the POA&M with `WeaknessSource` = "ACAS" and the associated NIST control ID from the mapping.
2. **Given** a previously open ACAS finding is now resolved in a subsequent scan import, **When** the updated .nessus file is imported, **Then** the corresponding POA&M weakness entry is flagged for review/closure.

---

### Edge Cases

- What happens when a .nessus file contains hosts that are not associated with the registered system? Findings are imported and linked to the system; host identity mismatches are logged as warnings.
- How does the system handle a .nessus file exported from a non-ACAS Tenable Nessus scanner? The same parser applies — the .nessus XML schema is identical regardless of whether the source is ACAS or commercial Nessus.
- What happens when a plugin has a severity of "0" (Informational)? Informational plugins are excluded from finding persistence but are counted in the import summary totals. Host-level metadata from informational plugins (e.g., OS detection, service enumeration) is captured in the host properties.
- How does the system handle a .nessus file with no `<ReportHost>` entries? The import completes with status `CompletedWithWarnings` and a warning that no hosts were found.
- What happens when the .nessus file exceeds the maximum allowed size? The import is rejected before parsing with a clear error message specifying the size limit.
- How are plugins with CVSS scores but no CVE references handled? The CVSS score is preserved on the finding; control mapping falls back to plugin-family heuristics.

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: System MUST parse standard Tenable .nessus XML files (NessusClientData_v2 schema) and extract all `<ReportHost>` blocks and their `<ReportItem>` entries.
- **FR-002**: System MUST extract the following fields from each plugin result: plugin ID, plugin name, plugin family, severity (0–4), risk factor, CVE references, CVSS base score, synopsis, description, solution, plugin output, port, protocol, and service name.
- **FR-003**: System MUST extract host-level properties from each `<ReportHost>`: hostname, IP address, operating system, MAC address, scan start time, and scan end time.
- **FR-004**: System MUST map Nessus severity levels to the existing CAT severity scale: severity 4 (Critical) → CAT I, severity 3 (High) → CAT I, severity 2 (Medium) → CAT II, severity 1 (Low) → CAT III. Severity 0 (Informational) plugins are excluded from finding persistence and counted in the import summary only.
- **FR-005**: System MUST automatically map vulnerability findings to NIST 800-53 controls using STIG-ID cross-references from `<xref>` elements resolved through the existing CCI crosswalk chain, supplemented by plugin-family heuristic mapping when STIG-ID xrefs are unavailable.
- **FR-006**: System MUST provide fallback control mapping via a curated, built-in plugin-family-to-control-family heuristic table when STIG-ID xref mapping is not available, and flag such mappings with a confidence indicator of "Heuristic" rather than "Definitive". The mapping table is not user-editable in this release.
- **FR-007**: System MUST support three conflict resolution strategies for re-imports: Skip (keep existing), Overwrite (replace with new), and Merge (keep more-recent, append details). A finding is uniquely identified by the composite key of Plugin ID + Hostname + Port.
- **FR-008**: System MUST support dry-run mode that produces a full import preview without persisting any data.
- **FR-009**: System MUST compute a SHA-256 hash of the uploaded file to detect duplicate imports and provide a warning when a previously imported file is re-submitted.
- **FR-010**: System MUST enforce a maximum file size limit for uploaded .nessus files, consistent with the existing scan import size constraints.
- **FR-011**: System MUST create a `ScanImportRecord` for each import operation with accurate counts of findings created, updated, skipped, and errored.
- **FR-012**: System MUST create individual `ScanImportFinding` records for each plugin-host-port combination to maintain an audit trail.
- **FR-013**: System MUST create or update `ControlEffectiveness` records for in-baseline NIST controls affected by the imported findings.
- **FR-014**: System MUST generate POA&M weakness entries for open Critical/High/Medium findings with `WeaknessSource` set to "ACAS".
- **FR-015**: System MUST log all import operations including success, failure, warnings, and unresolved control mappings for audit purposes.
- **FR-016**: System MUST validate that the target system exists and is a registered system before processing the import.
- **FR-017**: System MUST preserve the scan timestamp from the .nessus file's `HOST_START` and `HOST_END` properties for temporal tracking across assessment cycles.
- **FR-018**: System MUST restrict .nessus import operations to users with ISSO, SCA, or System Admin roles. Unauthorized users MUST receive an access denied error.

### Key Entities

- **NessusReportHost**: Represents a scanned host extracted from a .nessus file. Contains hostname, IP address, OS, MAC address, and scan time window. One .nessus file can contain multiple hosts.
- **NessusPluginResult**: Represents a single vulnerability finding for a host-port combination. Contains plugin metadata (ID, name, family, severity), CVE references, CVSS scores, remediation guidance, and port/protocol information. Uniquely identified by Plugin ID + Hostname + Port. Many plugin results belong to one host.
- **ScanImportRecord** (existing): Extended with a new import type value to track .nessus file imports using the same audit infrastructure as CKL/XCCDF/Prisma imports.
- **ScanImportFinding** (existing): Stores per-finding audit trail. For Nessus imports, the vulnerability ID field stores the plugin ID and the rule ID field stores the primary CVE (if available).
- **ControlEffectiveness** (existing): Updated when imported findings map to in-baseline NIST controls, reflecting the vulnerability impact on control effectiveness.
- **POA&M Weakness** (existing): Created for open Critical/High/Medium findings with `WeaknessSource` = "ACAS" and the mapped NIST control ID.

## Success Criteria *(mandatory)*

### Measurable Outcomes

- **SC-001**: Users can import a standard .nessus file and see all vulnerability findings appear in the system within 60 seconds for files containing up to 10,000 plugin results.
- **SC-002**: At least 80% of vulnerability findings with CVE references are automatically mapped to the correct NIST 800-53 controls without manual intervention.
- **SC-003**: Users can perform a dry-run preview of any .nessus file import and receive a complete summary before committing changes.
- **SC-004**: 100% of Critical, High, and Medium severity findings from ACAS imports generate corresponding POA&M weakness entries, eliminating manual transcription of ACAS findings into the POA&M.
- **SC-005**: Teams can track vulnerability trends across consecutive ACAS scans by comparing import summaries over time for the same system.
- **SC-006**: Zero data loss during re-imports — conflict resolution strategies preserve or update findings according to the selected strategy without orphaning records.
- **SC-007**: Reduce the time for teams to correlate ACAS scan results to NIST 800-53 controls from hours of manual work to under 5 minutes per scan file.

## Assumptions

- Teams have access to export .nessus files from ACAS in the standard NessusClientData_v2 XML format. ATO Copilot does not connect to ACAS directly.
- The existing CCI crosswalk data (used for CKL/XCCDF imports) includes sufficient CVE-to-CCI mappings to resolve the majority of common vulnerability CVEs. Where gaps exist, the system falls back to heuristic mapping.
- Plugin-family-to-control-family heuristic mappings follow established DISA patterns (e.g., "Windows: Microsoft Bulletins" → SI-2 Flaw Remediation, "Firewalls" → SC-7 Boundary Protection).
- File size limits and base64 encoding constraints are consistent with the existing scan import infrastructure.
- ACAS exports use the same .nessus XML schema as commercial Tenable Nessus — no ACAS-specific XML extensions need to be handled differently.
- Informational (severity 0) plugins are excluded from finding persistence to reduce storage bloat; their counts are tracked in the import summary and host-level metadata (OS, hostname) is captured on the host record.
