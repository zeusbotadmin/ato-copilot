## RMF Phase Workflows

### Phase 3: Implement (ISSO Lead)

**Objective**: Author SSP control narratives, batch-populate inherited controls, and get AI-assisted suggestions for customer controls.

**Step-by-Step**:

1. Auto-populate inherited narratives → Tool: `compliance_batch_populate_narratives`
2. Get AI suggestions for customer controls → Tool: `compliance_suggest_narrative`
3. Write/update narrative text → Tool: `compliance_write_narrative`
4. Track completion by family → Tool: `compliance_narrative_progress`

**Natural Language Queries**:

> **"Auto-populate the inherited control narratives for system {id}"** → `compliance_batch_populate_narratives` — fills ~40–60% of narratives from the embedded control catalog

> **"Suggest a narrative for AC-2 on system {id}"** → `compliance_suggest_narrative` — AI draft with confidence score

> **"Write the narrative for AC-2: 'Account management is implemented using Azure AD...'"** → `compliance_write_narrative` — stores the narrative with Implemented status

> **"What's the narrative completion for the SC family?"** → `compliance_narrative_progress` — per-family completion percentages

> **"Show all controls missing narratives for system {id}"** → `compliance_narrative_progress` — lists controls without narratives

**AI Suggestion Confidence Levels**:

| Score | Meaning | Action |
|-------|---------|--------|
| ≥ 0.85 | High confidence (inherited controls) | Review and accept |
| 0.70–0.84 | Good confidence (shared controls) | Review and customize |
| 0.50–0.69 | Moderate confidence (customer controls) | Significant review needed |
| < 0.50 | Low confidence — flagged | Write manually |

**Documents Produced**:

| Document | Format | Purpose |
|----------|--------|---------|
| SSP Narratives | Per-control records | Individual control implementation statements |

!!! warning "Air-Gapped Note"
    In disconnected environments, `compliance_suggest_narrative` and `compliance_batch_populate_narratives` (AI-generated suggestions) are **unavailable**. Write all narratives manually using `compliance_write_narrative`. Inherited control narratives can still be auto-populated from the embedded control catalog (no network required).

---

### Phase 4: Assess (ISSO Support)

**Objective**: Collect evidence, support the SCA during assessment, and coordinate finding remediation.

**Step-by-Step**:

1. Collect evidence from Azure → Tool: `compliance_collect_evidence`
2. Run compliance assessment → Tool: `compliance_assess`
3. Create remediation Kanban board → Tool: `kanban_create_board`
4. Assign remediation tasks to engineers → Tool: `kanban_assign_task`
5. Fix alerts with optional dry-run → Tool: `watch_fix_alert`

**Natural Language Queries**:

> **"Collect evidence for the AC family on subscription {sub-id}"** → `compliance_collect_evidence` — collects Azure resource evidence with SHA-256 hashing

> **"Run a compliance assessment on subscription {sub-id}"** → `compliance_assess` — runs NIST 800-53 compliance assessment

> **"Create a remediation board from the latest assessment"** → `kanban_create_board` — creates Kanban board from findings

> **"Assign task REM-003 to engineer Bob Jones"** → `kanban_assign_task` — assigns remediation task

> **"Fix alert ALT-12345 with dry run first"** → `watch_fix_alert` — previews remediation before executing

---

### Phase 6: Monitor (ISSO Day-to-Day)

**Objective**: Manage continuous monitoring, triage alerts, maintain baselines, and handle auto-remediation.

**Step-by-Step**:

1. Enable monitoring → Tool: `watch_enable_monitoring`
2. View alerts → Tool: `watch_show_alerts`
3. Acknowledge alerts → Tool: `watch_acknowledge_alert`
4. Fix or escalate → Tool: `watch_fix_alert` / escalate to ISSM
5. Track trends → Tool: `watch_show_alerts` with time filters

**Natural Language Queries**:

> **"Enable daily monitoring for subscription {sub-id}"** → `watch_enable_monitoring` — enables scheduled daily scans

> **"Show all critical alerts from the last 7 days"** → `watch_show_alerts` — filtered alert list

> **"Acknowledge alert ALT-12345"** → `watch_acknowledge_alert` — pauses SLA escalation timer

> **"What drifted this week?"** → `watch_show_alerts` — shows drift alerts for recent period

> **"Configure auto-remediation for Low severity drift alerts"** → auto-remediation rule creation

> **"Set quiet hours from 22:00 to 06:00 on weekdays"** → `watch_configure_quiet_hours` — suppresses notifications during off-hours

> **"Configure escalation: if Critical alert is not acknowledged in 30 minutes, notify the ISSM"** → `watch_configure_escalation` — defines escalation path

**Watch Monitoring Tools**:

| Tool | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `watch_enable_monitoring` | Enable scheduled/event-driven/combined monitoring |
| `watch_disable_monitoring` | Disable monitoring for a subscription |
| `watch_configure_monitoring` | Update frequency or mode |
| `watch_monitoring_status` | View all monitoring configurations |
| `watch_show_alerts` | List alerts with severity/status/family/time filters |
| `watch_get_alert` | Full alert details with history and correlations |
| `watch_acknowledge_alert` | Acknowledge (pauses SLA escalation) |
| `watch_fix_alert` | Remediate with optional dry-run |
| `watch_create_rule` | Create custom alert rules |
| `watch_list_rules` | List active alert rules |
| `watch_suppress_alerts` | Suppress alert patterns with expiration |
| `watch_configure_quiet_hours` | Set notification quiet hours |
| `watch_configure_notifications` | Configure channels (Chat, Email, Webhook) |
| `watch_configure_escalation` | Define escalation paths for SLA violations |

**Alert Lifecycle**:

```
New → Acknowledged → InProgress → Resolved
  ↓        ↓
Dismissed  Escalated (SLA violation)
```

**SLA Due Dates by Severity**:

| Severity | Due Date | Escalation |
|----------|----------|------------|
| Critical | 24 hours | After 30 min unacknowledged |
| High | 7 days | After 4 hours unacknowledged |
| Medium | 30 days | After 24 hours unacknowledged |
| Low | 90 days | After 7 days unacknowledged |

!!! info "Air-Gapped Note"
    In disconnected environments, Watch **event-driven** monitoring is unavailable (requires Azure Event Grid). Use **scheduled-only mode** with local policy cache. Alert notifications are limited to local channels (VS Code, audit log) — external email/webhook channels are unavailable.
