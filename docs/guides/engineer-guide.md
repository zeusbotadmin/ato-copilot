# SSP Authoring Workflow — Engineer Guide

> Feature 015: Persona-Driven RMF Workflows — US5: SSP Authoring & Narrative Management

This guide walks through the complete SSP authoring workflow using the MCP compliance tools, from initial system registration through SSP document generation.

!!! tip "New to ATO Copilot?"
    If this is your first time using ATO Copilot as an Engineer, start with the [Engineer Getting Started](../getting-started/engineer.md) page for prerequisites, first-time setup, and your first 3 commands.

---

## Prerequisites

Before starting SSP authoring, the following must be completed:

1. **System registered** — `compliance_register_system`
2. **Boundary defined** — `compliance_define_boundary`
3. **RMF roles assigned** — `compliance_assign_rmf_role`
4. **System categorized** — `compliance_categorize_system` (FIPS 199)
5. **Baseline selected** — `compliance_select_baseline` (NIST 800-53)
6. **Inheritance set** — `compliance_set_inheritance` (inherited/shared/customer designations)

The system must be advanced to the **Implement** RMF phase before SSP authoring begins.

## Step 1: Batch Populate Inherited Narratives

Start by auto-populating narratives for all inherited and shared controls. This is the fastest way to build initial SSP coverage.

```
Tool: compliance_batch_populate_narratives
Parameters:
  system_id: "<your-system-guid>"
```

This populates narratives using provider templates (e.g., "This control is fully inherited from Azure Government (FedRAMP High)"). It is **idempotent** — running it again will skip controls that already have narratives.

To populate only inherited controls first:

```
Tool: compliance_batch_populate_narratives
Parameters:
  system_id: "<your-system-guid>"
  inheritance_type: "Inherited"
```

Then populate shared controls separately:

```
Tool: compliance_batch_populate_narratives
Parameters:
  system_id: "<your-system-guid>"
  inheritance_type: "Shared"
```

**Expected result:** 40-60% of controls auto-populated depending on inheritance coverage.

---

## Step 2: Suggest Narratives for Remaining Controls

For customer-responsible controls that require manual authoring, use the suggestion tool to get AI-generated drafts:

```
Tool: compliance_suggest_narrative
Parameters:
  system_id: "<your-system-guid>"
  control_id: "AC-2"
```

The tool returns:
- **Suggested narrative text** — a draft based on system context and control requirements
- **Confidence score** — 0.85 for inherited, 0.75 for shared, 0.55 for customer controls
- **Reference sources** — NIST SP 800-53, FedRAMP, DoD SRGs

> **Important:** AI suggestions are drafts. Always review and customize before accepting.

---

## Step 3: Write Control Narratives

Write or update implementation narratives for individual controls:

```
Tool: compliance_write_narrative
Parameters:
  system_id: "<your-system-guid>"
  control_id: "AC-2"
  narrative: "Account management is implemented using Azure Active Directory..."
  status: "Implemented"
```

**Status options:**
| Status | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| `Implemented` | Control is fully implemented (default) |
| `PartiallyImplemented` | Control is partially implemented |
| `Planned` | Control implementation is planned |
| `NotApplicable` | Control does not apply to this system |

The tool uses **upsert behavior** — calling it again for the same (system_id, control_id) pair updates the existing narrative.

---

## Step 3b: Attach Evidence

After authoring a control narrative, attach supporting evidence to strengthen the implementation claim. From the **Compliance Dashboard**, navigate to the control narrative and click **Attach Evidence** to upload:

- **Screenshots** — showing configured settings, enabled security features
- **Scan results** — ACAS/Nessus/Prisma Cloud output for the control family
- **Configuration exports** — JSON/XML dumps from Azure Policy, Defender, or Group Policy
- **Policy documents** — signed ATO memos, SOPs, or operating procedures

You can also click **Collect Evidence** to automatically gather Azure Policy compliance snapshots and Defender assessment results for the control.

Evidence uploaded at the capability level (via the Capability Coverage page) is automatically inherited by all controls mapped to that capability, reducing duplicate uploads.

Browse all evidence for a system on the **Evidence** page in the sidebar.

---

## Step 4: Track Progress

Monitor SSP completion across all control families:

```
Tool: compliance_narrative_progress
Parameters:
  system_id: "<your-system-guid>"
```

This returns:
- **Overall percentage** — total completion across all controls
- **Per-family breakdown** — total, completed, draft, and missing counts per NIST family

To focus on a specific family:

```
Tool: compliance_narrative_progress
Parameters:
  system_id: "<your-system-guid>"
  family_filter: "AC"
```

**Progress classification:**
- **Completed** = `Implemented` or `NotApplicable`
- **Draft** = `PartiallyImplemented` or `Planned`
- **Missing** = No narrative record exists

**Target:** 100% completion before generating the final SSP.

---

## Step 5: Generate the SSP Document

Generate the complete System Security Plan:

```
Tool: compliance_generate_ssp
Parameters:
  system_id: "<your-system-guid>"
```

The generated Markdown document includes four sections:

| Section | Content |
|---------|---------|
| System Information | Name, type, mission criticality, hosting environment, RMF phase |
| Security Categorization | FIPS 199 notation, C/I/A impacts, DoD IL, information types |
| Control Baseline | Baseline level, overlay, total controls, tailoring/inheritance summary |
| Control Implementations | Per-family grouped controls with narratives and status |

To generate only specific sections:

```
Tool: compliance_generate_ssp
Parameters:
  system_id: "<your-system-guid>"
  sections: "system_information,categorization"
```

**Warnings:** The tool reports controls with missing narratives in the `warnings` array. Resolve these before final submission.

---

## Recommended Workflow Order

| Step | Tool | Persona | Purpose |
|------|------|---------|---------|
| 1 | `compliance_batch_populate_narratives` | Platform Engineer | Auto-fill inherited controls |
| 2 | `compliance_narrative_progress` | Security Lead | Review initial coverage |
| 3 | `compliance_suggest_narrative` | Platform Engineer | Get AI drafts for remaining controls |
| 4 | `compliance_write_narrative` | Platform Engineer | Write/edit customer narratives |
| 5 | `compliance_narrative_progress` | Security Lead | Verify completion |
| 6 | `compliance_generate_ssp` | Security Lead | Produce final SSP document |

---

## Tips

- **Start with batch populate** — it handles inherited controls automatically and is idempotent
- **Use family_filter** in progress checks to focus on one family at a time
- **Write narratives iteratively** — use `PartiallyImplemented` status for in-progress work
- **Review AI suggestions** — confidence scores indicate reliability; lower scores need more review
- **Generate SSP incrementally** — use the `sections` parameter to generate and review one section at a time
- **Check warnings** — the SSP generator flags controls missing narratives; address these before assessment

---

## Architecture Notes

- **Entity:** `ControlImplementation` — stores per-control narratives with unique constraint on `(RegisteredSystemId, ControlId)`
- **Service:** `ISspService` / `SspService` — business logic with `IProgress<string>` support for long-running operations
- **Tools:** 5 MCP tools registered via DI in `ServiceCollectionExtensions.cs` and wired in `ComplianceMcpTools.cs`
- **Tests:** 35 unit tests (`SspAuthoringToolTests.cs`) + 5 integration tests (`SspAuthoringIntegrationTests.cs`)

---

## Remediation Workflows

ATO Copilot provides two remediation paths:

| Path | Tools | When to Use |
|------|-------|-------------|
| **Standalone** | `compliance_generate_plan` → `compliance_remediate` → `compliance_validate_remediation` | Quick fixes by finding ID — no task tracking needed |
| **Kanban** | `kanban_task_list` → `kanban_remediate_task` → `kanban_task_validate` | Task-managed remediation with assignment, audit trails, and POA&M export |

### Standalone Remediation

Use the standalone tools when you want to fix a finding directly without task tracking:

| Step | Command | Tool | Purpose |
|------|---------|------|---------|
| 1 | Generate remediation plan | `compliance_generate_plan` | Prioritized plan for all findings on a subscription |
| 2 | Remediate with dry run | `compliance_remediate` | Preview fix — `dry_run: true` by default |
| 3 | Apply the fix | `compliance_remediate` | Set `dry_run: false` to apply |
| 4 | Validate the fix | `compliance_validate_remediation` | Re-scan to confirm finding is resolved |

!!! tip "Remediation workflow chaining"
    After an assessment reveals findings, generate a remediation plan first (`compliance_generate_plan`), then fix individual findings (`compliance_remediate`). Always validate after applying (`compliance_validate_remediation`).

### Kanban Remediation Workflow

When the ISSO or ISSM creates a remediation board from assessment findings, engineers receive Kanban tasks to fix compliance issues.

### Task Lifecycle

```
Backlog → ToDo → InProgress → InReview → Done
                     ↕
                  Blocked
```

### Common Commands

| Command | Tool | Purpose |
|---------|------|---------|
| Show my assigned tasks | `kanban_task_list` | View assigned remediation tasks |
| Show task details | `kanban_get_task` | Full details with control ID, resources, script |
| Move to In Progress | `kanban_move_task` | Start working on a task |
| Fix with dry run | `kanban_remediate_task` | Preview remediation before applying |
| Validate the fix | `kanban_task_validate` | Re-scan resources to verify remediation |
| Collect evidence | `kanban_collect_evidence` | Collect compliance evidence for the task |
| Move to In Review | `kanban_move_task` | Submit for ISSO review |

### Status Transition Rules

| Transition | Rule |
|-----------|------|
| → Blocked | Requires blocker comment |
| Blocked → | Requires resolution comment |
| → Done | Requires validation pass (or officer override) |
| → InProgress | Auto-assigns if unassigned |
| → InReview | Triggers automatic validation scan |
| Done → anything | Terminal — cannot reopen |

## VS Code IaC Diagnostics

ATO Copilot integrates compliance checking directly into your VS Code editing experience:

- **IaC Diagnostics** — Compliance findings appear as squiggly underlines in Bicep, Terraform, and ARM template files
  - CAT I / CAT II findings → Error severity (red underline)
  - CAT III findings → Warning severity (yellow underline)
- **Quick Fix** — Lightbulb Code Actions suggest fixes based on STIG findings
- **Hover Info** — Hovering over a flagged resource shows the NIST control, STIG rule, and CAT severity
- **`@ato` Chat Participant** — Ask compliance questions in the Copilot Chat panel

---

## CKL Import & Export from VS Code

> Feature 017: SCAP/STIG Viewer Import

Engineers can import CKL checklist files and XCCDF scan results directly through the `@ato` Chat Participant in VS Code, and export CKL files for DISA STIG Viewer review.

### Importing a CKL File

Use the chat participant to import a CKL checklist:

```
@ato Import this CKL file for my Windows Server system
```

The AI will invoke `compliance_import_ckl` with the file content and map STIG findings to NIST controls in your baseline.

### Importing XCCDF Scan Results

```
@ato Import SCAP scan results for system Eagle Eye
```

The AI resolves the system name to a UUID and invokes `compliance_import_xccdf`.

### Exporting a CKL Checklist

```
@ato Export a CKL checklist for the Windows Server 2022 STIG on Eagle Eye
```

The exported CKL file can be opened in DISA STIG Viewer or uploaded to eMASS.

### Reviewing Import History

```
@ato Show import history for Eagle Eye
@ato Show details of import <import-id>
```

### Available Import Tools

| Tool | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `compliance_import_ckl` | Import DISA STIG Viewer CKL checklist |
| `compliance_import_xccdf` | Import SCAP Compliance Checker XCCDF results |
| `compliance_import_prisma_csv` | Import Prisma Cloud compliance CSV export |
| `compliance_import_prisma_api` | Import Prisma Cloud API JSON (enhanced) |
| `compliance_export_ckl` | Export CKL for STIG Viewer / eMASS upload |
| `compliance_list_imports` | List import history for a system |
| `compliance_get_import_summary` | Detailed per-finding import breakdown |
| `compliance_list_prisma_policies` | List Prisma policies with NIST mappings |
| `compliance_prisma_trend` | Compare scan imports for remediation progress |

---

## Prisma Remediation Workflow

Cloud engineers can view Prisma-sourced findings with remediation guidance and execute CLI scripts to fix issues.

### Viewing Prisma Findings with Remediation Guidance

After an ISSO or ISSM imports Prisma Cloud scan results, findings are available as `ComplianceFinding` records with:

- **RemediationGuidance** — Human-readable fix instructions from the Prisma policy
- **RemediationScript** — CLI script (e.g., `az storage account update ...`) extracted from API JSON imports
- **AutoRemediable** — Whether the finding can be auto-remediated via CLI

```
@ato Show open Prisma Cloud findings for Eagle Eye with remediation steps
@ato What CLI scripts are available for Eagle Eye Prisma findings?
```

### CLI Remediation Scripts from API JSON Imports

When Prisma API JSON is imported (vs. CSV), CLI remediation scripts are extracted and stored on each finding:

```
@ato Import Prisma API scan results for Eagle Eye
```

After import, the summary shows `cli_scripts_extracted` count — the number of findings with actionable CLI commands.

### Resource-Centric Filtering

Use the `group_by` parameter on trend analysis to focus on specific resource types:

```
Tool: compliance_prisma_trend
Parameters:
  system_id: "<system-guid>"
  group_by: "resource_type"
```

This groups findings by Azure resource type (e.g., `Microsoft.Storage/storageAccounts`, `Microsoft.Sql/servers`), helping engineers prioritize remediation by resource category.

### Prisma Policy Catalog

```
Tool: compliance_list_prisma_policies
Parameters:
  system_id: "<system-guid>"
```

View all Prisma policies affecting the system, their NIST control mappings, and open/resolved counts to identify which policies need immediate attention.

---

## Interconnection Registration

> Feature 021: Privacy & Interconnections

Engineers can register system-to-system interconnections they discover during implementation. These records feed into the ISA documents generated by the ISSM.

### Adding an Interconnection

```
@ato Add an interconnection to the HR payroll system on Eagle Eye
```

The AI invokes `compliance_add_interconnection` to record:
- Remote system name, organization, and contact
- Connection direction (Inbound, Outbound, Bidirectional)
- Protocol and port
- Data types transmitted
- Security controls at the boundary

### Listing Interconnections

```
@ato List all interconnections for Eagle Eye
```

### Engineer Responsibilities

- Register any new interconnection discovered during development
- Provide technical details (protocol, port, data flow)
- Update interconnection records when architecture changes
- Coordinate with ISSM for ISA generation and agreement registration

---

## SSP Section Contribution

> Feature 022: SSP Authoring & OSCAL Export

Engineers contribute to SSP sections 5 (System Environment) and 6 (System Interconnections) — the technically-scoped sections that document infrastructure and connectivity.

### Writing an SSP Section

```
@ato Write SSP section 5 (System Environment) for Eagle Eye
```

The AI invokes `compliance_write_ssp_section` to create or update the section content. Engineers write sections; the ISSM reviews and approves them.

### Checking SSP Completeness

```
@ato What is the SSP completeness for Eagle Eye?
```

Returns a per-section status breakdown so engineers can see which sections remain in Draft or NotStarted.

### Engineer SSP Workflow

```
1. compliance_write_ssp_section (section 5) ← Document system environment
2. compliance_write_ssp_section (section 6) ← Document interconnections
3. compliance_ssp_completeness              ← Verify section status
4. ISSM reviews via compliance_review_ssp_section
```

---

## Narrative Governance

> Feature 024: Version Control + Approval Workflow

### Viewing Narrative History

```
@ato Show me the version history for AC-1 in Eagle Eye
```

Tool: `compliance_narrative_history` — returns all versions with author, timestamp, and change reason.

### Comparing Versions

```
@ato Compare versions 1 and 3 of the AC-1 narrative for Eagle Eye
```

Tool: `compliance_narrative_diff` — shows a unified diff between two versions.

### Rolling Back a Narrative

```
@ato Roll back the AC-2 narrative to version 2 for Eagle Eye
```

Tool: `compliance_rollback_narrative` — creates a new version with the old content. Blocked if the narrative is currently under review.

### Submitting Narratives for Review

```
@ato Submit the AC-1 narrative for Eagle Eye for ISSM review
```

Tool: `compliance_submit_narrative` — transitions Draft/NeedsRevision → UnderReview.

### Batch Submit by Family

```
@ato Submit all AC family narratives for Eagle Eye for review
```

Tool: `compliance_batch_submit_narratives` — submits all Draft narratives in a family at once.

### Checking Approval Progress

```
@ato What is the narrative approval progress for Eagle Eye?
```

Tool: `compliance_narrative_approval_progress` — shows per-family approval %, review queue, and staleness warnings.

### Engineer Narrative Governance Workflow

```
1. compliance_write_narrative (with change_reason)    ← Edit narrative
2. compliance_narrative_history                       ← Verify version
3. compliance_submit_narrative or batch_submit        ← Submit for review
4. compliance_narrative_approval_progress             ← Track progress
5. If NeedsRevision: fix and resubmit
```

## HW/SW Inventory — Component Registration

> **Feature 025** — Engineers register the software components they deploy and keep version information current.

### Registering a Software Component

After deploying a new application or service, register it in the inventory:

```
Tool: inventory_add_item
Parameters: {
  "system_id": "{system-id}",
  "item_name": "my-api-service",
  "type": "software",
  "function": "Application",
  "vendor": "Internal",
  "version": "1.2.0",
  "parent_hardware_id": "{server-id}"
}
```

### Updating Version After Deployment

When you push a new version, update the inventory to keep it current:

```
Tool: inventory_update_item
Parameters: {
  "item_id": "{item-id}",
  "version": "1.3.0",
  "patch_level": "2024-01-15"
}
```

### Checking Inventory Coverage

```
Tool: inventory_list
Parameters: {
  "system_id": "{system-id}",
  "type": "software",
  "search": "api"
}
```

## Enterprise Hardening Operations (Feature 029)

### Configuring Rate Limits

Edit `RateLimiting:Policies` in `appsettings.json` or override with environment variables:

```bash
export RateLimiting__Policies__0__PermitLimit=60
export RateLimiting__Policies__0__WindowSeconds=120
```

### Monitoring Setup

**Prometheus**: Set `OpenTelemetry__EnablePrometheus=true` and scrape `/metrics`.

**OTLP**: Set `OpenTelemetry__OtlpEndpoint=http://collector:4317` for Jaeger/Grafana Tempo.

Key metrics: `ato.copilot.http.request.duration`, `ato.copilot.http.request.total`, `ato.copilot.cache.hits`, `ato.copilot.cache.misses`.

### Enabling Offline Mode

```bash
export Server__OfflineMode=true
```

Available offline: NIST control lookups, STIG data, RMF guidance, cached assessments, document generation.
Unavailable: AI chat, ARM scans, live assessments, Prisma Cloud.

### Cache Header Interpretation

- `X-Cache: HIT` — Response served from cache (fast)
- `X-Cache: MISS` — Fresh response from service (slower)
- `X-Cache-Age: 45` — Cached entry is 45 seconds old

---

## Boundary Management Workflows (Feature 033)

Engineers can manage authorization boundaries through both the dashboard and MCP chat:

### Dashboard Workflow
1. Navigate to Portfolio → System → Boundaries
2. Click "+ Add Boundary" to create Physical, Logical, or Hybrid boundaries
3. Use "Discover Azure Resources" to auto-discover and import resources from Azure
4. View boundary-scoped gap analysis via the boundary selector on the Gap Analysis page

### MCP Chat Workflow
- `@ato list boundary definitions for [system]` — view all boundaries
- `@ato create a logical boundary named "Production" for [system]` — create boundary
- `@ato run boundary gap analysis for [system]` — compare coverage across boundaries
- `@ato define boundary resources and assign to Production` — assign resources to boundary

---

## Narrative Cascade & AI Regeneration (Feature 036)

### Cascade Regeneration

When a **security capability** or **component** is updated, all linked control narratives are automatically regenerated using deterministic templates. This ensures narratives always reflect the current state of your security posture.

**Triggers:**

- Capability description, provider, or name change
- Component name, description, or owner change
- Component assigned to or removed from a system

**Safeguards:**

- **Manually customized** narratives are never overwritten — the cascade skips them
- A **NarrativeVersion** snapshot is created before each update, preserving the audit trail
- Each narrative's `CurrentVersion` is incremented after regeneration

### AI-Assisted Narrative Regeneration

For individual control narratives, engineers can request an **AI-generated** narrative via the dashboard:

1. Navigate to a system's Narratives page
2. Click the **Regenerate with AI** button on a control implementation
3. The system queries linked capabilities, components, and boundary context
4. An AI model generates a tailored narrative incorporating all context
5. A NarrativeVersion is created and the narrative is marked `AiSuggested = true`

!!! note "AI Must Be Enabled"
    AI regeneration requires Azure OpenAI to be configured (`AzureAi__Enabled=true`). If not configured, the endpoint returns HTTP 503.

### Capability Coverage View

The Capability Coverage page (`/systems/{systemId}/capability-coverage`) provides a matrix showing how capabilities map to controls for a given system:

- **Summary cards**: Total capabilities, mapped controls, populated/custom/empty narrative counts, coverage percentage
- **Expandable rows**: Each capability shows its role (Primary/Supporting/Shared), narrative progress, and linked components
- **Narrative breakdown**: Per-capability counts of populated, custom, empty, and AI-suggested narratives

---

## POA&M Visibility (Feature 039)

Engineers have read-only access to POA&M data for their assigned systems:

- **View POA&M Items**: Navigate to `/systems/{systemId}/poam` to see all POA&M items with severity, status, and due dates
- **Task Cascade**: When a remediation task linked to a POA&M is completed, a cascade confirmation asks whether to also close the POA&M item
- **Component Context**: POA&M items linked to components you own appear in the component detail view
- **Chat Queries**: Use `compliance_list_poam` or `compliance_poam_metrics` for quick status checks
